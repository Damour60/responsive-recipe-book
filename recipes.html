      <h2 class="push-1-4 not-bold">Spiced Chocolate Crinkle Cookies</h2>
      <p class="push-1-2">The secret to these easy holiday cookies is using melted chocolate and oil instead of butter. The oil and chocolate allow the crinkle to form while baking. Play around with the spices and create an original combination!</p>
      <p class="push-1-2 giga bold">Ingredients</p>
      <p class="push-1-2">½ cup vegetable oil<br>
      4 oz unsweetened chocolate, melted and cooled<br>
      2 cups granulated sugar<br>
      1 tsp pure vanilla extract<br>
      4 eggs<br>
      2 cups all-purpose flour<br>
      2 tsp baking powder<br>
      1 tsp kosher salt<br>
      1 tsp ground cinnamon<br>
      1/2 tsp ground cayenne pepper<br>
      1 cup icing sugar<br>
      <p class="push-1-2 giga bold">Preparation</p>
      In a medium bowl, sift together flour, baking powder, salt and spices and set aside. In a large bowl, combine vegetable oil, melted chocolate, sugar and vanilla with a wooden spoon.<br>
      Beat in eggs, one at a time. Fold in the flour mixture, cover with plastic wrap and chill for at least 2 hours.<br>
      Preheat oven to 350°F. Line cookie sheets with parchment paper. Sift icing sugar into a wide shallow bowl. Drop chilled dough by tablespoons into icing sugar and roll to form into a ball. Place cookies about 2” apart on cookie sheet.<br>
      Bake cookie 8-10 minutes, until just set. Take care not to overbake. Remove cookies to cooling rack immediately.<br></p>

          <h2 class="push-1-4 not-bold">Linzer Cookies</h2>
          <p class="push-1-2">The secret to these festive cookies is the addition of toasted almond flour! It’s best to use a seedless jam, but any flavour will do! Use your favourite or traditional raspberry, like we did.</p>
          <p class="push-1-2 giga bold">Ingredients</p>
          <p class="push-1-2">1 1/2 cups (3 sticks) unsalted butter, softened<br>
            1 1/4 cups granulated sugar<br>
            1 1/2 cups whole blanched almonds<br>
            2 eggs, room temperature<br>
            3 cups all-purpose flour<br>
            2 tsp kosher salt<br>
            1 tsp baking powder<br>
            1 tsp vanilla extract<br>
            1 cup best quality seedless raspberry jam<br>
            1 cup icing sugar<br>
            All-purpose flour for rolling</p>
            <p class="push-1-2 giga bold">Preparation</p>
            <p class="push-1-2">In a large skillet over medium heat, toast the almonds until just golden brown, and allow to cool to room temperature. Process in a food processor until fine, taking care not to overprocess into almond butter. Place ground almonds in a bowl with flour, salt and baking powder, whisk together and set aside.<br>
            In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the butter and sugar on medium speed until combined, about two minutes. Add in the eggs one at a time, stopping the mixer to scrape down the sides of the bowl between eggs. Add the almond and flour mixture and vanilla extract and mix on low speed until just combined.<br>
            Divide the dough into thirds in the bowl, and wrap each third shaped into a disc tightly in plastic wrap, for at least two hours or overnight. Dough can be frozen at this point for up to two weeks.<br>
            After dough is chilled, remove all three discs from the fridge and let them rest at room temperature for 20 minutes. Lightly flour your rolling surface and unwrap one third of the dough, kneading a few times to make it pliable. Roll dough 1/8” thick, sprinkling with flour as needed to prevent sticking, and place on a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper.<br>
            Repeat with the other two discs of dough, stacking the dough sheets on top of the first one. Wrap with plastic and return to the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.<br>
            Preheat oven to 325°F. Remove one sheet of dough from the refrigerator. Using a 2” round fluted cookie cutter, cut rounds and arrange on a parchment lined baking sheet. Follow with a second sheet, and after rounds are transferred, use a 1” fluted cutter to cut a round out of the middle. Continue pattern with last sheet of dough. Gather the cut scraps, knead together and shape into a disc. This dough can be used to cut more cookies after chilling.<br>
            Bake cookies in preheated oven for until just golden on the bottom, 12-15 minutes, rotating pan halfway through baking. Remove and cool on a cooling rack.<br>
            Spread the whole cookies with 1 tsp jam each, leaving a little border around the edge uncovered. Using a sieve, sprinkle the cookies with the centres cut out with icing sugar. Place sugared cookie on top of jam cookie and sandwich together. Cookies can be baked ahead, and sandwiched together before serving.<br>
            Servings: Makes about 3 dozen cookies</p>

              <h2 class="push-1-4 not-bold">Peanut Butter Sandwich Cookies with Peanut Buttercream</h2>
              <p class="push-1-2">If you answer “peanut butter” to the “what’s your favourite cookie” question, you may want to sit down. This is the ultimate peanut butter cookie, we defy you to find one that could be more peanut buttery. Fine, you could roll these in some toasted peanuts, but that’s literally the only way to cram any more peanut flavour into this...wait, that’s not a bad idea...<br>
                A light and fluffy peanut buttercream is sandwiched between two soft and chewy peanut butter oat cookies for one tasty treat. Serve with a large glass of milk — and dip or drizzle with melted dark chocolate if desired!</p>
                <p class="push-1-2 giga bold">Ingredients</p>
                <p class="push-1-2 mega">Peanut Butter Cookies:</p>
                <p class="push-1-2">1 cup all-purpose flour<br>
                1/2 tsp baking soda<br>
                1/2 tsp baking soda<br>
                1/2 tsp baking powder<br>
                1/4 tsp salt<br>
                1/2 cup unsalted butter, room temperature<br>
                1/2 cup smooth peanut butter, room temperature<br>
                2/3 cup packed brown sugar<br>
                1/3 cup granulated sugar<br>
                1 egg<br>
                1 cup quick cooking rolled oats</p>
                <p class="push-1-2 mega">Peanut Butter Buttercream:</p>
                <p class="push-1-2">1/3 cup smooth peanut butter<br>
                1/4 cup unsalted butter<br>
                1 1/2 cup icing sugar<br>
                4 tsp 35% whipping cream (approx.)<br>
                Pinch salt</p>
                <p class="push-1-2 giga bold">Preparation</p>
                <p class="push-1-2 column">Preheat oven to 350°F degrees. Whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt; set aside.<br>
                Beat together the butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar with electric beaters until light and fluffy. Beat in the peanut butter. Beat in the egg until incorporated. Beat in the vanilla. Stir in flour mixture and then beat just until blended. Fold in the oats. Cover and place in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours and up to 2 days. (This will make them easy to roll and shape.)<br>
                Using a tablespoon to measure, roll the dough into roughly 1-inch balls. Arrange them on parchment paper-lined baking sheets, spacing them about 2-inches apart. Press to flatten each using the tines of a fork.<br>
                Bake in middle the middle of the oven, one tray at a time, until cookies are set around the edges but still a little soft in the centre, about 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to wire rack to cool completely. Makes about 28 cookies.</p>
                <p class="push-1-2 mega">Peanut Butter Buttercream:</p>
                <p class="push-1-2 column">Beat the butter and peanut butter with an electric mixture until combined. Slowly beat in the icing sugar on low speed. Beat in the cream and the sprinkle of salt; mix until smooth and fluffy. If the cream is too thick, add 1 to 2 teaspoons more cream. (Makes 1 heaping cup.)<br>
                Spread or pipe a heaping tablespoon of buttercream on half of the cookies and top with the remaining cookies. Press to sandwich them.<br>
                Servings: Makes about 14 sandwich cookies.</p>

                  <p class="push-1-2">There’s nothing like the aroma of ginger cookies baking. Well, except, eating them when they are warm and fresh out of the oven.</p>
                    <p class="push-1-2 giga bold">Ingredients</p>
                    <p class="push-1-2">2 cups + 2 tbsp all-purpose flour<br>
                    2 tsp baking soda<br>
                    2 tsp ground ginger<br>
                    1 tsp ground cinnamon<br>
                    1/2 tsp ground allspice<br>
                    1/2 tsp salt<br>
                    1/4 tsp each ground cloves and nutmeg<br>
                    Pinch cayenne pepper<br>
                    3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature<br>
                    1 cup packed brown sugar<br>
                    1 egg<br>
                    1/4 cup molasses<br>
                    1 tsp vanilla extract<br>
                    Coarse decorating or granulated sugar, for rolling</p>
                    <p class="push-1-2 giga bold">Preparation</p>
                    <p class="push-1-2 column">Whisk together flour, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, salt, cloves, nutmeg and cayenne pepper; set aside.<br>
                    Beat butter and brown sugar with electric beaters until light and fluffy, scraping down sides of bowl as needed. Beat in egg until combined. Stir in molasses and vanilla until blended. Stir in dry ingredients; beat just until blended. Cover and let stand in refrigerator for at least 1 hour and up to 2 days. (This will make them easy to roll and shape.)<br>
                    Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Using a tablespoon to measure, roll dough into roughly 1-inch balls. Roll the balls in sugar to coat and place on parchment paper-lined baking sheets, spacing about 2-inches apart. Press dough with tines of fork in a crisscross pattern to flatten slightly. Top with a pinch more sugar. (If the dough is too soft to work with, pop in freezer for a few minutes to firm up.)<br>
                    Bake in middle of the oven, one tray at a time, until the cookies are set around the edges but still a little soft in the centre, about 9 to 11 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store in an airtight container for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 1 month.</p>
                    <p class="push-1-2 mega">Recipe notes:</p>
                    <p class="push-1-2 column">For fully-loaded ginger cookies, add chopped pecans, white chocolate chunks and chopped crystallized ginger to the dough.<br>
                    Coarse sugar for cookies, also called decorative or sanding sugar can be found at bulk food stores. It really does make the ginger cookies sparkle but granulated sugar is just as pretty and delicious.<br>
                    Servings: Makes about 30 cookies</p>
